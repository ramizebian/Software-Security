Week 1 quiz

1. Three of the following are classic security properties; which one is not?

Availability (+)
Confidentiality
Correctness
Integrity

2. What was the first buffer overflow attack?

Love Bug
SQL Slammer
Morris Worm (+)
Code Red

3. The stack is memory for storing

Local variables (+)
Program code
Dynamically linked libraries
Global variables

4. Why is it that the compiler does not know the absolute address of a local variable?

Programs are not allowed to reference memory using absolute addresses
The size of the address depends on the architecture the program will run on
As a stack-allocated variable, it could have different addresses depending on when its containing function is called (+)
Compiler writers are not very good at that sort of thing

5. When does a buffer overflow occur, generally speaking?

when writing to a pointer that has been freed
when copying a buffer from the stack to the heap
when a pointer is used to access memory not allocated to it (+)
when the program notices a buffer has filled up, and so starts to reject requests

6. How does a buffer overflow on the stack facilitate running attacker-injected code?

By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code (+)
By writing directly to the instruction pointer register the address of the code
By writing directly to %eax the address of the code
By changing the name of the running executable, stored on the stack

7. What is a nop sled?

It is an anonymous version of a mop sled
It is a sequence of nops preceding injected shellcode, useful when the return address is unknown (+)
It is a method of removing zero bytes from shellcode
It is another name for a branch instruction at the end of sequence of nops

8. The following program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow (assuming the absence of automated defenses like ASLR, DEP, etc., which we introduce in the next unit). What is the name of the buffer that can be overflowed?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define S 100
#define N 1000

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char out[S];
  char buf[N];
  char msg[] = "Welcome to the argument echoing program\n";
  int len = 0;
  buf[0] = '\0';
  printf(msg);
  while (argc) {
    sprintf(out, "argument %d is %s\n", argc-1, argv[argc-1]);
    argc--;
    strncat(buf,out,sizeof(buf)-len-1);
    len = strlen(buf);
  }
  printf("%s",buf);
  return 0;
}

out (+)
len
buf
msg

9. Here is the same program as the previous question. What line of code can overflow the vulnerable buffer?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define S 100
#define N 1000

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char out[S];
  char buf[N];
  char msg[] = "Welcome to the argument echoing program\n";
  int len = 0;
  buf[0] = '\0';
  printf(msg);
  while (argc) {
    sprintf(out, "argument %d is %s\n", argc-1, argv[argc-1]);
    argc--;
    strncat(buf,out,sizeof(buf)-len-1);
    len = strlen(buf);
  }
  printf("%s",buf);
  return 0;
}

sprintf(out, "argument %d is %s\n", argc-1, argv[argc-1]); (+)
printf(msg)
len = strlen(buf);
strncat(buf,out,sizeof(buf)-len-1);
printf("%s",buf);

10. Recall the vulnerable overflow from the previous two questions. We can change one line of code and make the buffer overrun go away. Which of the following one-line changes, on its own, will eliminate the vulnerability?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define S 100
#define N 1000

int main(int argc,char *argv[]) {
  char out[S];
  char buf[N];
  char msg[] = "Welcome to the argument echoing program\n";
  int len = 0;
  buf[0] = '\0';
  printf(msg);
  while (argc) {
    sprintf(out,"argument %d is %s\n",argc-1,argv[argc-1]);
    argc--;
    strncat(buf,out,sizeof(buf)-len-1);
    len = strlen(buf);
  }
  printf("%s",buf);
  return 0;
}

change printf("%s",buf) to printf(buf);
change printf(msg) to printf("%s",msg);
change char msg[] = "Welcome to the argument echoing program\n" to char msg[42] = "Welcome to the argument echoing program\n"
change sprintf(out, "argument %d is %s\n", argc-1, argv[argc-1]) (+)
to snprintf(out, S, "argument %d is %s\n", argc-1, argv[argc-1])

11. Recall the vulnerable program from the previous few questions. Which of the following attacks do you think the program is susceptible to?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define S 100
#define N 1000

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char out[S];
  char buf[N];
  char msg[] = "Welcome to the argument echoing program\n";
  int len = 0;
  buf[0] = '\0';
  printf(msg);
  while (argc) {
    sprintf(out, "argument %d is %s\n", argc-1, argv[argc-1]);
    argc--;
    strncat(buf,out,sizeof(buf)-len-1);
    len = strlen(buf);
  }
  printf("%s",buf);
  return 0;
}

code injection
data corruption
reading arbitrary addresses in memory
all of the above (+)

12. Recall the program again.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define S 100
#define N 1000

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char out[S];
  char buf[N];
  char msg[] = "Welcome to the argument echoing program\n";
  int len = 0;
  buf[0] = '\0';
  printf(msg);
  while (argc) {
    sprintf(out, "argument %d is %s\n", argc-1, argv[argc-1]);
    argc--;
    strncat(buf,out,sizeof(buf)-len-1);
    len = strlen(buf);
  }
  printf("%s",buf);
  return 0;
}

If we changed printf("%s",buf) to printf(buf) then the program would be vulnerable to what sort of attack?
heap overflow
format string attack (+)
use-after-free attack
all of the above

13. Exploitation of the Heartbleed bug permits

overwriting cryptographic keys in memory
a kind of code injection
a read outside bounds of a buffer (+)
a format string attack

14. Why is it that anti-virus scanners would not have found an exploitation of Heartbleed?

It's a vacuous question: Heartbleed only reads outside a buffer, so
there is no possible exploit
Anti-virus scanners tend to look for viruses and other malicious
code, but Heartbleed exploits steal secrets without injecting any code (+)
Heartbleed exploits are easily mutated so the files they leave
behind do not appear unusual
Heartbleed attacks the anti-virus scanner itself

15. An integer overflow occurs when

an integer expression's result "wraps around"; instead of creating a very large number, a very small (or negative) number ends up getting created
an integer is used as if it was a pointer
an integer is used to access a buffer outside of the buffer's bounds
there is no more space to hold integers in the program (+)
